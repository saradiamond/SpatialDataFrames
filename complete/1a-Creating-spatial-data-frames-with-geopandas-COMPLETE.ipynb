    "### What is a spatial dataframe\n",
    "A **spatial dataframe** (aka a **geodataframe** or **spatially enabled dataframe**) is much like a typical Pandas dataframe except that it accomodates a new datatype:  ***geometries*** . Geometries, as you might guess represent geometric features: points, lines, and polygons -- each of which is defined by a one or series of coordinate pairs. These spatial dataframes are also assigned a **coordinate reference system (crs)** which links these coordinates to specific places on the Earth and allows us to do geospatial analysis. In other words, these spatial dataframes are quite the same as our familiar GIS feature classes!"

First is **geopandas**, which has been around for a while, and then there's the newcomer, the **ArcGIS API for Python** (which really needs a better name). In this notebook we explore the former, **geopandas**, focusing in on how we create the GeoDataframes from existing data in various formats. The ArcGIS API for Python will be examined in a different notebook."
